## HackNITR 2.0 2021
#### For the "HackNITR 2.0" Hackathon 2021

## SocialGood - FarmPay
#### Let's help our Country's Farmers!!

# Website:

Our Website will help Wholesalers to see a list of crops that every farmer is selling and also the bids that other wholesalers have made. This allows him to make a comapratively better bid, which results in profits for both farmers and wholesalers. 
## (It is to be noted that the bid which any wholesaler makes, should always be higher than the current MSP of the crop.) 
ALso, wholesalers can recheck their stocks anytime and if needed, they can create a refill request which will be visible to all other wholesalers, who can accept these requests if they want and have the required stocks. Also the wholesalers can see all their previous transactions.
