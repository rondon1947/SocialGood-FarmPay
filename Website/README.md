# SocialGood - FarmPay
### Let's help our Country's Farmers!!

Our project is from the track - "Social Good". Our Project FarmPay provides a "Farmer-Wholesalers" business portal, incorporating the fields of Web Development and App Development. This project is made in consideration of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which provides an electronic trading platform for both farmers and wholesalers. Thus, this will save the time, both of farmers and consumers and also reduce bargaining pratices so that profit on both end isn't compromised. Our application keeps track of all transactions and also provide legal advice to farmers regarding contract farming.

## The different fields of our project include:

### App: 
Our App will help the Farmers to easily sell their crops, with a good profit, by providing them with a platform to create an auction-type selling of their crops, where bids are made by every interested wholesaler. Also, we aim to provide knowledge to our Farmers about latest farming techniques and other information related to the agricultural team. Also, we try to help them legally too, by providing them legal assisstance about contract farming. And as an extra feature, we are planning to add a community feature for farmers from a particular area so that they can interact with each other and also provide them assistance in the proper dispose of the stubble by acting as a mediator between them and companies that use these crop-leftovers to make organic compost, thus, preventing stubble burning.
### Website: 
Our Website will help Wholesalers to see a list of crops that every farmer is selling and also the bids that other wholesalers have made. This allows him to make a comapratively better bid, which results in profits for both farmers and wholesalers. 
#### (It is to be noted that the bid which any wholesaler makes, should always be higher than the current MSP of the crop.) 
ALso, wholesalers can recheck their stocks anytime and if needed, they can create a refill request which will be visible to all other wholesalers, who can accept these requests if they want and have the required stocks. Also the wholesalers can see all their previous transactions.
