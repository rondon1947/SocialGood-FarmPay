# SocialGood - FarmPay
### Let's help our Country's Farmers!!

Our project is from the track - "Social Good". Our Project FarmPay provides a "Farmer-Wholesalers" business portal, incorporating the fields of Web Development and App Development. This project is made in consideration of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which provides an electronic trading platform for both farmers and wholesalers. Thus, this will save the time, both of farmers and consumers and also reduce bargaining pratices so that profit on both end isn't compromised. Our application keeps track of all transactions and also provide legal advice to farmers regarding contract farming.

##Overview of the Problem
The Indian agriculture acts of 2020, often referred to as the Farm Bills, are three acts initiated by the Parliament of India in September 2020. The Lok Sabha approved the bills on 17 September 2020 and the Rajya Sabha on 20 September 2020. The President of India, Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent on 27 September 2020. From then on, a lot of fear gripped our Country's farmers mostly because of several misconceptions and a lot lies spread among them by oportunistic people. Farmers had the following main concers:
- **Farmers want minimum support price for each crop as they want fair amount for their hard work.** -
- **Farmers due to lack of awareness do not know the different ways of approaching the Law to solve their problems regarding Contract Farming. So, they fear their lands would be taken away.** -
- **Since stubble burning has been banned by the new laws , farmers donâ€™t know how to get rid of the waste.** -
- **The new laws allows the unlimited hoarding of crops so in time of crisis the prices are bound to rise.** -

##Overview of the Solution Provided by us
FarmPay, as the name suggests is an smartphone application cum website made in consideration of the Farmers' produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) Act , 2020. This application provides an electronic trading platform for both farmers and wholesalers, having the following features:
- **Ensuring MSP for each transaction as the wholesalers will not be allowed to make a bid below the MSP.** -
- **Providing Legal advice to farmers for their doubts and problems regarding contract farming.** -
- **Providing assistance to farmers in turning their stubble to compost using different modern methods.** -
- **A well maintained central database to keep track of each transaction as well as stocks of all wholesalers.** -

## The different fields of our project ( and also how to use them ) include:

### App: 
Our App will help the Farmers to easily sell their crops, with a good profit, by providing them with a platform to create an auction-type selling of their crops, where bids are made by every interested wholesaler. Also, we aim to provide knowledge to our Farmers about latest farming techniques and other information related to the agricultural team. Also, we try to help them legally too, by providing them legal assisstance about contract farming. And as an extra feature, we are planning to add a community feature for farmers from a particular area so that they can interact with each other and also provide them assistance in the proper dispose of the stubble by acting as a mediator between them and companies that use these crop-leftovers to make organic compost, thus, preventing stubble burning.
### Website: 
Our Website will help Wholesalers to see a list of crops that every farmer is selling and also the bids that other wholesalers have made. This allows him to make a comapratively better bid, which results in profits for both farmers and wholesalers. 
#### (It is to be noted that the bid which any wholesaler makes, should always be higher than the current MSP of the crop.) 
ALso, wholesalers can recheck their stocks anytime and if needed, they can create a refill request which will be visible to all other wholesalers, who can accept these requests if they want and have the required stocks. Also the wholesalers can see all their previous transactions.  

##Further improvements in the Future:

- **Converting app language to all possible regional languages of India for easier use by the farmers.** -
- **A Chat Window in the App so that Farmers can chat directly with lawyers and judges ready to help them in legal matters.** -
- **A Farmers' Community Group(like Whatsapp) so that they can collaborate on setting up co-operative enterprises to store and sell the grains.** -
