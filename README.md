# SocialGood - FarmPay
Let's help our Country's Farmers!!

Our project is from the track - "Social Good". Our Project FarmPay provides a "Farmer-Wholesalers" business portal, incorporating the fields of Web Development and App Development. This application is made in consideration of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (promotion and facilitation) Act, 2020, which provides an electronic trading platform for both farmers and wholesalers. Thus, this will save the time, both of farmers and consumers and also reduce bargaining pratices so that profit on both end isn't compromised. Our application keeps track of all transactions and also provide legal advice to farmers regarding contract farming.
